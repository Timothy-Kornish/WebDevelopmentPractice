        <p style ="text-family:cursive">Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of âˆ’2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.</p>

                <p>Europa most likely has an ocean under the top layer of ice that is most woubl be heated from the thermal energy created by gravitational tidal waves. These tidal waves originiate from the the orbitala resonance between Eruopa and the other moons around Jupiter.</p></li>
